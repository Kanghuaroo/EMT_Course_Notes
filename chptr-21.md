# Resucitation

Function of heart is to pump blood.
Does this using electrical signals to signal a contraction.

## Mechanical Failure of the Heart
 - Loss of normal heart muscle structure
 - Pulseless Electrical Activity

## Electrical Dysfunction of the Heart
 - Asysytole is complete failure of the electrical system
 - Dysrhythmias
   - Too slow
   - Too fast
   - Ventricular tachycardia (V-Tach)
   - Ventricular Fibrilation (V-Fib)
 - Shockable Rhythms are
   - Pulseless V-Tach
   - V-Fib

## Sudden vs Asphyxial Cardiac Arrest
 - Sudden
   - Abrupt onset of dysrhythmia
   - Acute blunt trauma to chest causesing commotional cordis
   - O2 levels are normal at start
 - Asphyxial
   - Heart stops due to systemic hypoxia
   - Has a forseeable progression
 - Agonal Respirations
   - Primal Reflex and are not proper breaths

## Effects of Cardiac Arrest
 - Heart Fails to pump
 - Blood stops moving
 - Cells cannot create energy and DIE

## Pediatric Cardiac Arrest
 - Children cardiac arrests are generally asphyxia
 - Generally predictable after a steady decompensation

## Patient Assessment
 - Do not have Perceptual Narrowing on patientA
 - Primary Assessment
   - No Pulse
   - No Breath (apnea)
   - Unresponsive

## Improving Cardiac Arrest Survival
 1. Recognition and activation of the Emergency Response System
 2. Immediate high-quality CPR
 3. Rapid Defibrilation
 4. Basic and Advanced Life Support
 5. Advanced Life Support and Postarrest Care
