# Anatomy and Physiology
## Musculoskeletal
  - Gives shape
  - Skeleton
  - Skull
    - Mandible: bottom Jaw (moves)
  - Spinal column
    - 33 Vertebrae that encase spinal cord
    - Vital for movement, sensation, and vital functions
    - Cervical 7
    - Thoracic 12 
    - Lumbar 5
  - Thorax
    - 12 ribs and sternum
    - Protects the heart, lungs major vessels
  - Pelvis
    - Ilium
    - Ischium
    - Pubis
    - Hip Joint
  - Lower Extremities
    - Femur
    - Patella
    - Tibia
    - Fibula
    - Ankle
      - Lateral Malleous
      - Tarsals
  - Upper Extremities
    - Clavicle
    - Scapula
    - Acromion Process
      - Acromioclavicular joint
    - Humerous
    - Radius
    - Ulna
  - Joints

## Respitory System
	- "Air" is approximately 21% air
	- Larynx
		- Midwaypoint of airway

## Cardiovascular System
  - Heart
		- Four Chambers
		  - Two Atria (upper area)
			- Two ventricles (lower area)
		- Pathway of blood through heart
		  1. Right Atria
			2. Right Ventricle
			- Detour to lungs via plumonary artery -> lungs -> pulmonary vein
			3. Left Ventricle
			4. Left Atria
  - Bradychardia - slow heartrate less than 60
	- Tachychardia - fast heartrate more than 100
	- Conduction System
	  1. Sinoatrial node ( pacemaker ) 
		2. Atrioventricular node
		3. Atrioventricular bundle ( bundle of his )
		4. Bundle branches
		5. Purkinje fibers
	- Circulation of the blood
	  - Coronary arteries
		- Aorta
		- Pulmonary Artery
		- Carotid artery
		- Femoral artery
		- Brachial artery
		- Radial artery
		- Posterioor tibial artery
		- Dorsalis pedis artery
	- Composition of Blood
	  - Plasma: Volume filler
		- Red Blood Cells: Oxygen Transport
		- White Blood Cells: Immune System
		- Platlets: clotting
	- Pulse
	  - Peripheral pulse
		  - Radial
			- Brachial
			- Posterior tibial
			- Dosalis pedis
		- Central pulse
			- Carotid
			- Femoral
		- Peripheral pulses are felt with normal blood pressure (~80)
	- Blodd pressure
	  - Force on blood vessels
		- Systolic: upper reading when left ventricle contracts
		- Diastolic: lower reading when left ventricle refills
	- Perfusion
	  - Adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the cells of the body, with the removal of wate products
	  - Hypoperfusion (shock) is not enough perfusion
- Lymphatic System
	- Fluid transfer system
	- Lymphoid Organs
		- Adenoids
		- Tonsils
		- Spleen
		- Thymus
		- Nodes
- Nervous System
	- Central Nervous
	  - Brain
		- Spinal cord
	- Peripheral Nervous System
	  - Sensory Nerves
		- Motor nerves
	- Autonomic nervous system
	  - Involuntary motor functions
- Digestive System
  - Food digestion and transport
	- Stomach
	- Small Intestine
	- Large Intestine
  - Liver
	- Gallbladder
	- Pancreas
	- Spleen
	- Appendix
# Integumentary System (Skin)
  - Protection
	- Water Balance
	- Temperature regulation
	- Excretion
	- Shock (impact) absorption
	- Layers
	  - Epidermis
		- Dermis
		- Subcutaneous
# Endocrine
  - Hormones that regulate body activities
	- Pancreas with insulin
	- Adrenal glands
	  - Epinephrine

# Renal System
  - Urinary System
	- Regulate fluid levels, filter chemicals, and adjust body pH levels
	- Kidneys
	- Bladder
	- Ureters: transport urine to bladder from kidneys
	- Vrethra: Excretes urine from the bladder to external environment

# Reproductive Systems
  - Male
		- Penis
		- Testes
	- Female
	  - Uterus
		- Vagina
		- Ovaries
