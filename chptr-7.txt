# Principles od Pathophysiology
Study of how disease processes affect the body

## The Cell
 - Mitochondria converts glucose and nutrients into ATP
 - Glucose is the energy
 - Insulin must match the body's glucose requirement
 - Oxygen is used for Aerobic metabolism
 - Membranes may be altered due to disease

## Regulation of Hemeostatis
 - Regulation  via hypothalamus and medulla oblongata
 - pH 7.35 - 7.45

 ## Cardiopulmonary System
  - Lungs and Heart
		- Oxygen
		- Distribution of blood
		- Removal of waste products
	- Normal CO2 is 35 - 45
	- Airway MUST be open (patent)
	- Lungs
		- Tidal Volume: volume of air moving in and out
		- Tidal Volume * respitory rate = minute volume
			- Amount of air in one minute
		- hypoxia: low oxygen
		- hypercapnia: high CO2
	- Blood
		- Plasma Oncotic Pressure: plasma protiens that attract water away from are around cells and puts into bloodstream
		-Hydrostatic pressure: Water being pushed into the cells
		- Hypertension: high blood pressure
	- Heart
		- Stroke (pump)
			- Approx 90mL blood per pump
			- Preload: Blood returing to heart
			- Contractility: how hard heart squeezes
			- Afterload: Pressure the heart has to pump against to force blood out into the system
		- Cardiac Output: Stroke volume * beats per minute
		- tachycardia reduces cardiac output due to not being able to refill
		- Dysfunction
			- Mechanical
			- Electrical
	- Ventilation(V) must match Perfusion (Q) V/Q match

## Shock
  - Hypoperfusion to the muscles
	- Hypovolemic: low blood volume
	- Distributive: low blood vessel tone / cannot give oxygen
	- Cardiogenic: heart fails to pump
	- Obstructive: blood cannot flow
	- Symptoms
		- Altered mental status
		- Increased heart rate
		- Increased respiratory rate
		- Delayed capillary refill time
		- Pale, cool, clammy skin
		- Sweating
	- Decompensated shock occurs when compensatory measures fail
		- decreased blood pressure
	- Irreversible shock happens when things die

## Fluid Balance
  - Body is 60 percent water
		- Inracellular is 70%
		- Intravascular is 5%
		- Interstitial is 25%
	- Poor fluid distribution
		- Edema: swelling associated with the movement of water

## Nervous System
  - Brain and spinal cord
	  - Covered by protective layers (meninges)
		- Layer of shock-absorbing fluid (cereborosprinal fluid)
		- Still subject to damage from trauma or disease
	- Medical Dysfunctions
		- Stroke
		- Infection
		- Disease: Lou Gehrig, MS
		- hypoglycemia: Low blood sugar

## Endocrine System
	- Hormone secreation
	- Brain
	- Kidneys
	- Pancrease
	- Dysfunction can be either too many or too little hormones
	- Adrenal Insufficiency; can be also be supressed with medicines

## Digestive System
  - Mourth-to-butt
	- Diharrea: three watery stools over three days
	- WASH YOUR HANDS

## Immune System
  - Hypersensitivity is a good reason to not use medications
