# Diabetic Emergencies and Altered Mental Status

## Pathophysiology
  - Normal Consciousness is regulated by Reticular Activating System (RAS)
    - Keeps you awake
    - Paying attention
    - Sleeping
      - Requirements
      - Food
      - Oxygen
      - Water
  - Altered Mental Status (AMS) is cause in disruption to RAS
      - Ras Deficiencies
      - Trauma, infection, toxing
      - Brain Problems
      - Problems within another body system
  - AMS can be DANGEROUS - call police if needed
  - Check for Airway
    - Poor Respiratation = AMS
  - Ask for baseline if there are family around
  - AMS is indicitive of a SERIOUS underlying issue
  - Glasgoww Coma Scale to provide precise measurement of patint responsiveness; less than 8, ventilate
    - Eye Opening Response
      4. Spontaneously
      3. To Speech
      2. To Pain
      1. No Response
    - Verbal Response
      - Oriented to time, place, and person
      - Confused
      - Inappropriate words
      - Incomprehensible sounds
      - No Response
    - Motor Response
      - Obeys Commands
      - Moves to localised pain
      - Flex to withdraw from pain
      - Abnormal flexation
      - Abnormal Extension
      - No Response

## Diabetes
Glucose is a form of sugar and is the body's basic source of energy.
Body cells require glucose to remain alive and create energy

Glucose cannot enter cells without insulin.
Insulin is made in the pancreas (part called Islets of Langerhans) when glucose exceeds 90mg/dL.
Thus inslin spikes after eating usually.
Insulin binds to receptor sites on cells to allow glucose enter cells.

Normal glucose levels in the blood are essential to maintaining normal mental status.

Type 1 Diabetes is inability to CREATE Insulin.
Type 2 Diabetes is inability to RESPOND to Insulin.

## Diabetic Emergencies
### Hypoglycemia: Low Blood Sugar.
This means that the body (and brain) is STARVING

Causes:
 - Too much Insulin
 - Too little sugar intake
 - Overexercising or overexertion
 - Vomiting
 - Increased Metabolic Rate

Symptoms:
 - Altered Mental Status: acts like being drunk
 - Sudden Onset
 - Pale, sweaty skin
 - no breath smell

Treatment:
  - Give oral glucose

### Hyperglycemia: High Blood Sugar
Insulin Deficency caused by inability to produce insulin.
Develops over days or weeks.
Cells *STARVE* because glucose cannot *ENTER* cells.

Symptoms:
 - Chronc thirst and hunger
 - Increased Urination
 - Nausea
 - Dehydration
 - red, warm skin
 - acetone smell on breath

Due to this starvation, fats and protiens are digested instead.
Waste from this leads to ***Diabetic Ketoacidosis*** (DKA).
DKA leads to AMS.

## Blood Glucose Meters
 - Use Ambulance's Glucose Meters over personal ones
 - Hypoglycemia: less than 60 mg/dL
 - Hyperglycemia: over 140 mg/dL  

## Other Causes of AMS
### Seizures
A disruption of the electrical activity in the brain.
Partial Seziures are only in a some part of the brain.
Generalized Seizures affect the entire brain AND consciousness to the patient.

#### Tonic-Clonic Seizures:
 - Tonic
   - Body is rigid for up to 30 seconds
   - no breathing
   - loose bowel and bladder control
 - Clonic
   - Jerking for 1-2 minutes
 - Postictal Phase
   - Convulsions stop
   - Consciousness is regained
   - Patient is drowsy or violent

#### Causes
 - Adults: fail to take anti-seizure medications
 - Children: high fevers
 - General Other: Hypoxia, stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury
 - Rare Other: Toxins, Hypoglycemia, Brain Tumor, Congenital Brain Defects, Toxins, Etc.
 - Diseases: Epilepsy, Measles, Mumps, Eclampsia, Heat Stroke, Onset of Syncope

### Epilepsy
Blanket term for seizures with unknown cause.

May be precedented by an "aura".

If one happens put them on ground and clear hazards.

#### After
 - Protect the Airway
 - Treat any injuries recieved
 - Transport to medical facility

### Status Epilepticus
Two or more convlsive seizures in a row or a single seizure 10 or more minutes.
Requires IMMEDIATE transport and ALS support.

### Stokes
Death or Injury of brain tissues from oxygen deprivation.
Ischemic stroke is caused by a blockaage that occurs due to clot or embolism.
Hemorragic Stoke is popped anurysm
Transiet Ischemic Attack: Ischemic that resolves itself within 24 hrs and is "fine", but a major indicator of a future ischemic stroke.
#### Aphasia
Inability to express ideas with words.
Expressive: knows what they want, says wrong thing
