# Abdominal Injuries
There are MANY organs and many systems in the abdomen.

The Abdomen is the region between the diaphragm and the pelvis.
    - Digestive
    - Reproductive
    - Endocrine
    - Regulatory

The abdomen itself is further divided into four quadrants.
The Peritoneum is a thin membrane lining the abdominal cavity and covering each organ.
Parietal peritoneum attached to abdominal walls.
Extraperitoneal Space: outside space from parietal lining.
Retoperitoneal Space

## Visceral Pain
Comes from organ itself.
Described as 'dull' or 'achy'.
The fewer nerve endings allow for only diffuse sensations.

## Parietal pain
Originates from the parietal peritoneum.
Many nerve endings allow for easier locating of pain.
Described as 'sharp'.

## Tearing Pain
Not the most common type of abdominal pain.
Originates in the aorta or stomach.

## Referred Pain
Perception of pain in skin or muscles at distant locations.
Signals get 'crossed' from one system to another due to nearby systems.

## Appendicitis
Infection of appendix.
RLQ Pain.

## Peritonitis
Infection of peritoneum, usually caused by foreign material in peritoneal space.
Irritation causes involuntary contraction of abdominal muscles

## Cholecystitis/Gallstones
Inflammation of gallbladder.
Often caused by blockage of bile flow by gallstones.
Symptoms often worsened by ingestion of fatty foods.
Severe RUQ or epigastric pain and shoulder.

## Pancreatitis
Inflammation of the pancreas.
Common in patients with chronic alcohol abuse.
Signs:
    - Epigastric pain

## Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding
Bleeding within the GI tract, fro esophagus to rectum.
May be minor to severe.
Location of bleeding can be determined by color.
Dark blood = high bleed.
Red blood = low bleed.

## Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
    - Ballooning or weakening of inner wall of the aorta
    - Tears and separates from outer layers (dissection)
    - Weakened vessel bulges, may continue to grow
    - MAY EVENTUALLY RUPTURE
    - SNS:
      - Progressive sharp or tearing pain
      - signs of shock

## Hernia
Hole in the muscle layer of abdominal wall, allowing tissue or parts of organs (commonly intestines) to protrude or against skin.
May cause strangulation of tissue of bowel obstruction.

May be precipitated by heavy lifting.
Requires transport to hospital for evaluation.

SNS:
    - Sudden onset of abdominal pain, often following lifting
    - Palpable mass or lump on abdominal wall or crease to groin

## Renal Colic
Severe flank pain caused by kidney stones traveling down the ureter.
SNS:
    - Severe pain in flank or back
    - Frequently radiates to groin
    - Nausea, Vomiting

## Cardiac Involvement
Pain from Myocardial Infarction may be felt as abdominal discomfort.

## Abdominal Pain with Female
Ectopic Pregnancy

## Assessment and Care
Many potential causes.
EMT role is NOT to diagnose.
 - Perform thorough secondary assessment.
 - Identify serious or life-threatening conditions.
 - Abdomen should be soft and tender to palpations
   - SnTTS
Transport in position of comfort if conscious or in recovery (left lateral recumbent) position if unconscious.

# VOMIT
    - Vital SIgns
    - Oxygen
    - Monitor
    - Iv (done by paramedics)
    - Transport
