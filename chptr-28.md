# Soft-Tissue Injuries

## Siftt Tissues

    - Skin
        - Major Functions
            - Protection
            - Water Balance
            - Temperature Regulation
        - Layers
            - Epidermis
            - Dermis
            - Subcutaneous
    - Fatty Tissues
    - Muscles
    - Blood Vessels
    - Connective Tissues
    - Membranes
    - Glands

### Closed Wounds

Injuries that do not break the skin.
Body is Still Closed.

Causes:
    - Contusions
    - Hematomas
    - Closed Crush Injuries

### Open Wounds

Skin is broken.
Body is OPEN to the world.

#### Abrasians and Lacerations

Reduce Wound contamination, there is saline that can be used of light debriedment.

#### Penetrations

Do not remove the object if it is still there.
Check for exit wounds of firearms.
Stab wounds are usually an indication that another one may be on the patient.

#### Avulsions
Fold skin back into a "normal" position.
IF organ is completely torn away, save in sterile dressing and keep moist with saline.

#### Amputations

#### Genital Injuries
Preserve Avulsed Parts.
Consider the possibility of a sexual assult.
Stay Calm and Professional in treatment.

#### Burns
Can reach down beyond external skin, four may types.
Pay attention to cause of burns: fire, chemical, radiation
Monitor Airway if inhaled burns.
Do not be distracted from spinal damage.
Rule of Nine: Body can be divided into sections that are ~9% of body.
Rule of Palm: The size of the palm is ~1% body siza.
Burns to 20% or more of the body is a serious burn.

### Dressings and Bandaging
Dressing: Applied to cover wounds to pretect it.
Bandage: Holds dressings in place.
# Hematologic and Renal Emergencies

## Hematologic System
Blood is it's own organ system with specific functions.
Delivers oxygen, transports things, and stops bleeding.
Main Components are:
    - Red Blood Cells
    - White Blood Cells
    - Plasma
    - Platelets

### Clotting
Done via platelets.
Clotting factors are made in liver.
Clotting happens through clotting cascades.

### Coagulopathies
Abnormal Clotting, either happens too fast or clots too slowly.
Medications can change how a patient clots.
i.e. asprin

## Anemia
Lack of red blood cells in circulations.

## Sickle Cells
Genetic Disease that changes the shape of the red blood cells to become sickles.
Sickle shape can also damage organs or "get stuck".
i.e. spleen damage, priapism

Give supplemental oxygen and monitor for hypoperfusion.

## Renal System
2 Kidneys > 2 ureters > One urethra

Kidneys filters blood of waster products and maintains water balance.

### Urinary Tract Infections
Causes pain and frequent urination.
Can also cause Altered Mental Statuses due to fever and dehydration.

### Kidney Stones
Calcium stones formed within kidneys.
Jump / tap foot; if pain then kidney stones.

### Urinary Catheters
Helps people pee.
Do NOT remove.
Has a ballon that MUST be deflated for safe removal.

### Renal Failure
Kidneys no work no more.
If not reversible, then dialysis is needed.
Two main kinds:
 - Acute Renal Failure from poisons or events
 - Chronic from missing dialysis

Care:
 - CPAP
 - Get AED ready

## Dialysis
Complications:
 - Bleeding from A-V fistula
    - Pressure to bleeding / tourniquet if needed and possible
### Hemodialysis
"Normal" dialysis

### Peritoneal Dialysis
Put liquid into stomach to clean blood, then remove
