# Airway Management
## Physiology
	- Divided by Lyrnx
  - Upper airway
		- Mouth
		- Nose
		- Naso
	- Lower airway
		- Alveoli sacs
		- Carina: trachea splits into bronchial tubes
	- Children have smalled and shorter airways

## Pathophysiologgy
  - Obstructions can interfere airflow
	- Airway should be initially evaluated and monitored for patency over time
	- Anaphylaxis blocks airway
	- Swelling due to injury
	- Sounds
		- Stridor - high pitched whistling; narrowed air passage
		- Hoarseness - vocal chord swelling
		- Snoring - diminished muscle tone
		- Gurgling - liquid in the airway

Pertinant questions are
 - Is airway open?
 - Will it stay open?

Avg Breaths per minutes are 12-20

## Opening the Airway
  - Airway has precedence to spinal issues
	- But look for clues of possible spine issues
	- Head thrust chin tilt
	- Modified jaw thrust if spine injured

## Airway Adjuncts
	- Things to keep airway open after stopping maneouvers
	- OPA - Oropharyngeal
		- Must have NO GAG REFLEX
	- NPA - Nasopharyngeal
	- Keep suction nearby
### Oropharyngeal
	- Measure OPA
		- Mouth-to-ear
		-Center of mouth to angle of jawbone
	- Insert
		1. Open Mourth
		2. Put in "upside down"
		3. Rotate 180
### Nasopharyngeal
 - Measure
		- Nostril to tip of the ear
		- LUBE UP NPA
### Supraglottic
	- For longer rides
	- Pls try easer ones earlier
	- Roles : Suction,

## Suctioning
  - Suction MOUTCH, not THROAT
	- Gravity can be step 1; easy, instant
	- Suctioning devices can be used
	- 300 mmHg of suction
	- Use gloves
	- 10 secs at a time
	- suction on the way out

## Special Considerations
	- Facial Injuries: Bleeding may require frequent suctions
	- Obstructions: suction bad for solid objects
	- Dentures should be left in place
	- Partial Dentures can stay too, but may fall out
