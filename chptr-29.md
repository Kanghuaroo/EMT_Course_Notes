# Bleeding and Shock

## Circulatory System
### Heart
Pumps blood around.
### Vessels
 - Arteries: carry oxygenated blood away from the heart. Can bleed out from arteries in 2-3 minutes.
 - Capillaries: microscopic blood vessels that exchange gases with cells.
 - Veins: carry deoxygenated blood to heart. has valves that prevent back flow.
### Blood
Transport nutrients to body and waste away.

## Shock
Lack of perfusion to the body.

Four Causes:
 - Hypovolemia: Volume Problems
 - Cardiogenic Shock: Pump Problems
 - Distributive Shock: Blood Vessel Tone Problems
 - Obstructive Shock: Obstruction of Blood Flow

### Hypovolemia
Volume is lost, can be anything in blood

### Cardiogenic
Blood is not moving due to heart not pumping efficiently.

### Blood Vessel Tone Problems
If all vessels dilate (get bigger) then bp tanks and blood cannot flow properly.

### Obstructive Shock
Blood flow is blocked somehow.
 - Pulmonary Embolism
 - Cardiac Tamponade
   - Becks Triad
     - Muffled Heart Sounds
     - Hypotension
     - Jugular Vein Distension
 - Tension Pneumothorax
   - Absent Lung sounds on affected side
   - Jugular Vein Distension
   - Tracheal Deviation

## Fight or Flight
When scared body dumps epinephrine and norepinephrine for "energy"
 - Blood vessels constrict
 - Skin becomes sweaty, cool, and pale
 - Kidneys produce less urine
 - Nausea and vomiting
 - Increased heart rate and contractility

This can cause compensated shock.

For pediatric patients faster heart rate is main compensation mechanism.
Thus a drop in blood pressure is not needed before treating.

### Decompensation
When body runs out of fuel compensation techinques stop.
 - Drop in blood pressure
 - mental status change
 - slow heart rate
 - slow respiratory rate

### Irreversible Shock
Organs fail due to vasoconstriction that was too long.

### Assessment
 - Check for major sources of bleeding
 - Airway protection
   - Make sure they do NOT become hypoxic
 - Circulation
   - Distal pulses disappear
   - Capillary Refill is slow (over 2 seconds)

## Treating Shock
Treat underlying sympoms.
    - Hypothermia
    - Acidosis
    - Coagulopathy
    - Hypocalcemia (cannot be done in the field)
Things to do:
    - Prevent Hypoxia
    - Prevent Heat loss
    - Place in Supine Position
    - Request ALS (have additional interventions)A

## Bleeding
Hemorrhage is severe bleeding.
EMT can only treat external bleeding.

Arterial Bleeding
Venus Bleeding
Junctional Bleeding
Capillary Bleeding

### Treatment
 - Direct Pressure
 - Hemostatic Agents
 - Wound Packing
 - Tourniquet
 
Nosebleed: Epistaxis

## Internal Bleeding
Cannot do anything in the field.
Transport to hospital ASAP.
Blood being expelled from orifices.
Tender abdomen.
