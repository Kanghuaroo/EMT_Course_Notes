# Cardia Emergencies

## Cardiac Anatomy and Physiology
    1. Vena Cava Vein
    2. Right Atrium
    3. Right Ventricle
    4. Pulmonary Artery / Lungs
    5. Left Atrium
    6. Left Ventricle
    7. Arteries
    8. (small arteries)
    9. capilaries
    10. venules
    11. veins

## Acute Cornoary Syndrome
    - Cardiac Compromise
    - blood supply to heart is blocked or damaged
    - No oxygen = death (ischemia)
    - Ischemia: is hypoxic conditions of the cells
    - Chest discomfort: Levine Sign
    - Radiate pain on left arm, jaw, or stomach
      - Can be confusedd with stomach ache
    - Dyspena
    - Sweating
    - Abnormal Pulse or Blood Pressure
    - Anxiety
    - Patient Assessment
      - Acute Pulmonary Edema
      - Swollen Ankles and Feet
      - Medic Alert Jewelry indicating cardiac problems
    - 12-lead ECG
      - Interpretation is for Doctors
      - Electro-functions of the heart
      - Prep
        - electrodes directly on chest
        - needs secure contact with the skin
        - remove clothing and jewelry
        - remove sweat and dead skin
        - Dry off if wet
      - Place Limb ones at equal spots
    - Asprin
    - Nitroglycerin
      - Dose: 0.4 mg
      - MUST TRANSPORT once giving nitro

## Cardiovascular Disorders
    - Coronary Artery Disease
      - Arteries of the heart are blocked
      - Risk Factors
        - Age
        - Heredity
        - Hypertension
        - Obesity
        - Lack of Exercise
        - Elevated Blood Cholesterol and Triglycerides
        - Cigarette Smoking
    - Angina Pectoris
      - Chest Pain caused by insufficient blood flow to the myocardium
      - Due to narrowed arteries secondary to coronary artery disease
      - pain increases during exercise
      - Possesion of notroglycerin is a good indication
    - Acute Myocardial Infarction
      - Heart Attack
      - Blood flow to heart stops
      - Thrombus: Blood Clot Formed within vessel
      - Emboli: blood clot travels to block smaller artery
    - Heart Failure and Acute Pulmonary Edema
      - Heart Failure
        - Congestive Heart Failure
        - Heart is unable to pump blood efficiently
        - Ability to perfuse body tissues is impaired
      - Right Sided Failure
        - Jugular Vein Distention
        - Pedal Edema
      - Left Sided Failure
        - Pulmonary Edema
        - Gas Exchange is impaired
    - Aneurysm
      - Walls of an artery bursts
