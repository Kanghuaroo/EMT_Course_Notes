# Trauma to the Head and Spine

## Traumatic Brain Injury
 - TBU is disruption of the normal functioning of the brain for a brief or long term
 - Concussion
   - Head is struck and force is transferred to the brain
 - Contusion
   - bruised brain with ruptured blood vessels
   - Coup Injury on side of the blow
   - Contrecoup occurs on the opposite side
 - Hematomas
   - Subdural: between brain and dura
   - Epidural: between dura and skull
   - Intracerebral: Blood pools within the brain
   - Hematomas increase Inter Cranial Pressure
     - This increases blood pressure and slows heart (Cushing Reflex)
     - Further pressure changes breathing
       - Tachypnea
       - Cheyne-Stokes Breathing
       - Central Neurogenic Hyperventilation
       - Ataxic Respirations
     - Herniation
       - Decorticate or Decerebrate posturing and other neurogenic posturing

## Wounds to the Neck
- Pressure in veins of neck are lower than atmospheric pressure
  - Injuries can easily introduce and air embolism into body
 - Use a gloved hand and occlusive dressing

## Spinal Cord Injury
- Spine is most often injured by energy that forces the spine beyond its normal range of motion
- Dermatome: area of the body surface that is controlled by a single nerve
- NEXUS Algorithm

## When to use a backboard
 - Short Transport
 - Big splint needed for multi trauma
 - May need CPR
 - When moving from a backboard to a stretcher is likely to cause excessive movements
 - Respiratory distress is a contraindicationA

## Spinal Motion Restriction for a Seated Position
1. Log-roll the patient to apply the backboard
2. Pad Voids between the board and head and torso
3. Secure the head last
4. Use foam-filled cushions, commercial devices, or blanket rolls to provide additional head immobilization
5. Tilt Pregnant patients to the left after immobilization
   1. Prevents baby from compressing the Vena Cava
6. Strap across the upper chest, pelvis, and thighs
