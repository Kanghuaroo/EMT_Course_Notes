 # Trauma to the Head Neck and Spine
The nervous system controls EVERYTHING and divided into the central and peripheral nervous system.

## Anatomy of the Head
 - Cranium
   - Frontal
   - Parietal
   - Temporal
   - Occipital
 - Facial
   - Mandible
   - Maxilla
 - Brain is held within the skull
   - 10 % blood
   - 10 % Cerebral Spinal Fluid
   - 80 % Brain
 - Spinal Cord
 - Spinal Column
   - 33 Vertebrae
     - 7 Cervical
       - C1: Atlas
       - C2: Axis
     - 12 Thoracic
     - 5 Lumbar
     - 5 Sacrum
     - 3 Coccyx

## Injuries to the Skull and Brain
 - The skull is highly vascularized and can bleed profusely
 - Blunt force can leave invisible injuries, i.e. concussions
 - Traumatic Brain Injury disrupts the normal functioning of the brain and may be brief or long-term
### TBIS
 - Concussions
 - Contusions
 - Lacerations
 - Hematoma: collection of blood withing brain tissue
   - Subdural: Pressure between dura and brain
   - Epidural: Presssure between dura and skin
   - Intracerebral: Blood pooling in brain
   - Pressure on Brain stem changes vitals
     - Tachypnea
     - Cheyne-Stokes Breathing
     - Central Neurogenic Hyperventilation
     - Ataxic Respirations
## Injuries to the face and jaw
 - The mandible can become dislocated

## Wounds to the Neck
 - Carotid Artery
 - Use an occlusive dressing

## Injuries to the Spine
 - Fractures with or without bone displacement
 - Dislocations
 - Muscular Strains
 - Disk Injury including compression
 - Primary injuries are usually direct force, but secondary injuries are more serious
   - Hypoxia, Hyperglycemia, swelling
 - Cervical and Lumbar Vertebrae are most susceptible to injury due to no support from other structures
 - Pain and Tenderness are important signs/symptoms
### Treatment
 - Aggressivly assure oxygenation and ventialtion
 - Check Blood Glucose
 - Treat as Trauma Patient

## When to leave a helmet on
 - Fit snugly
 - Airway is patent

Intercranial Pressure (ICP)
Foramen Magnum: Hole in skull that Spinal Cord comes out from
Cushing Reflex: Hypertension and bradycardia, irregular respirations
Alert and Oriented x4:
 - Who are you?
 - Where are you?
 - What time is it?
 - What was happening?
AVPU: Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive
Glasgow Coma Scale
