## Special Patients and Considerations

 - Patients taking anticoagulants
 - Pregnancies

## Treatment
 - Treat Immediate Life Threats
 - Revised Trauma Score
   - GCS Score
   - Systolic Blood Pressure
   - Respiration Rate


Beta Blockers will keep Heart Rate in a "normal level" and prevent Heart Rate from being used to compensate for issues.
