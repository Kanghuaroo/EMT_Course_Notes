# Respiratory Emergencies

## Respiration Anatomy and Physiology
 - Negaative pressure made via diaphragm brings air in
 - Inspiration
  - Active
  - Diaphragm

## Adequate Breathing
  - Sufficient to support life
  - Signs
    - Generally normal mental status
    - Brathing with ease
  - Rate
    - Adult 12 -20
    - School-Kids 18 - 30
    - Infants 30 - 60
    - Regular Rhythm
    - Sounds are normal and equal

## Inadequacy
  - Low Pulse Oxygen
  - Agonal Respirations
  - Irregular Rhythms
  - Diminished or absent lung sounds
  - Poor tidal volume

## Pediatric Notes
  - Much smaller airway
  - Proportionately larger tongues
  - Smaller, softer, more flexible trachea
  - Less developed cricoid cartilidge
  - Belly Breathing
  - Distress Sounds
    - Nasal Flaring
    - Grunting
    - Seesaw breathing
    - Retractions

## Patient Care
  - Assisted Ventilation with supplemental oxygen

## Breathing Difficulty
  - Patient's Subjective Perception
  - Feeling of labored or difficult brething
  - Amount of Distress FELT may not reflect ACTUAL severity
  - Can analyze with OPQRST
  - Lung Sounds
    - Wheezes: high pitches sounds caused by narrowed air passages
    - Crackles: Caused by fluid in alveoli
    - Rhonchi: Snore like cause by secretions in larger airways
    - Stidor: High pitches caused by partial obstruction of trachea or lyranx

## CPAP
  - Start at 15 L
  - Side effects
    - Low Blood pressure
    - Pneumothorax
    - Dryness of eyes
    - Risk of Aspiration
    - Claustrophobia
  - Contraindications
    - Nasuea
    - Cheest Trauma
    - Shock
    - Upper GI Bleed / recent gastric surgery
    - Conditions preventing a good mask seal

## COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
  - Chronic Bronchitis
  - Common in Smokers

## Emphysema
  - Alveoli Walls break down
    - Less surface area for ventilation

## Asthma
  - Chronic Disease with episodic exacerbations
  - Over broncho-constriction

## Pulmonary Edema
  - Fluid in alveoli / lungs
  - Congestive Heart Failure relation
    - Caused by excess presssure from capillaries
  - Patient experiences Dyspnea
  - Treatment
    - High concentraiton O2
    - CPAP to push fluid back

## Pneumonia
  - Infection inside one or both lungs
    - More common in right side

## Spontaneous Pneumothorax
  - Lung Collapse
  - Risks
    - Tall, thin people
    - Smokers or vapers
  - Sharp Pleuritic chest pain
  - Immediately Call for a medic
  - NO CPAP

## Pulmonary Embolism
  - Blockage in blood supply to lungs
  - Caused by Deep Vein Thrombosis
    - Lying down too much
    - casts
    - cancer
  - Signs and Symptoms
    - Sharp pleuric chest pain
    - shortness of breath
    - Anxiety
    - coughing
    - Tachycardia
  - Treatment
    - O2
    - Transport

## Epiglottitis
  - Infections of the epiglottis
  - SNS
    - Sore throat
    - tripod
    - Fever
    - Stridor
    - Muffled Voice
  - Treatment
    - Keep patient calm and comfortable

## Croup
  - Viral infection that results in inflamation
  - Loud, Barking Cough

## Bronchiolitis
  - Small airways become inflamed because of viral infection
  - Causedd by RSV

## Cystic Fibrosis
  - Genetic Disease
  - Thick, Sticky Mucus in lungs and GI
  - Causes infections

## Viral Infections
  - Most Common Issue
  - Sesonal + Allergies
  - Good Hygenie is best protectant

## Prescribed Inhalers
  -  Can assist patients with taking their own medications
  -  Generic: Albuterol, Metaproterenol, ipratropium

## Small Volume Nebulizer
  - Continuous flow of aerosolized medication
  - Use 6-8 L/m

## Assisted Breathing
Nasal Cannula < Non-rebreather < CPAP < Bag Valve Mask
