# Respiration and Artificial Ventilation
 - Ventilation: AIr in/out of lungs
 - Inhalation is active process
 - Exhalation is passive
 - Tidal Volume is air moved in ONE breath
 - Not all breath gets to alveoli
 - Alveolar Ventilation refers to the amount of air that hits alveoli
 - Alveoli > Bronchiole tubes

 ## Respiration
	- Hypercapnia : high level of CO2
	- Hypoxia: low Oxygen
	- Respiratory Distress
		- Compensation able to be done to self regulate breath
		- patient awake and normal
	- Respiratory Failure
		- Copenstation does not work
		- Metabolic needs are not met
		- Precursor to Respiratory Arrest
	- Assessment
		- Cyanosis is seen in skin, lips, toungue, ears, or nails
		- Retractions and Nasal flarings are seen (children usually)
		- Oxygen saturations readings are low (<95%)

ABC
	- Airway
	- Breathing
	- Circulation

## Positive Pressure Ventilation
	- Use positive pressure to force air or oxygen into the lungs
	- reslies on a force that is OPPOSITE of the force the body normally uses
	- 1/4 ration
	- Negative Side Effects
		- Pressure on heart reduecs output
		- air going into stomach: gastric distension
		- accidental hyperventialtion and vasoconstriction
