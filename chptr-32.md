# Musculoskeletal Trauma

Parts
 - Bones: Framework
 - Joints: Mobility
 - Muscles: Movement
 - Cartilage: Flexibility
 - Ligaments: Connects Bone to Bone
 - Tendons: Connect Muscle to Bone

## Anatomy of Bone
 - 206 bones in the body
 - 48 bones in hand

## Muscle Types
    - Skeletal - voluntary
    - Smooth - involuntary
    - Cardiac - Myocardial

## Mechanisms of Injury
 - Blunt Force
 - Fracture
   - Any break in a bone
   - Comminuted: several breaks
   - Greenstick: Incomplete Break
   - Angulated: Bent at angles
 - Dislocation: coming apart of a joint
 - Sprain: Ligaments are stretched/torn
 - Strain: overstretching or overexterion of muscle
 - Compartment Syndrome
   - Internal swelling so great that blod flow is lost

## Six P's of Assessment
 - Pain o tenderness
 - Pallor: pale skin
 - Parastehis: Pins and needles

## Splinting
 - Immobilization of injury
 - Reduces Pain
 - If there is no pulse distal to injury realign ONCE then splint
### Types
 - Rigid Splints
 - Formable Splints
 - Traction Splints
   - Counteracts muscle spasms and reduces pain
   - Types
     - Bipolar, Unipolar
   - Traction should be 10% of weight
### Application
 - CSM: Circulation, Sensory, Motion
 - Pad Voids
 - Measure size on unaffected side

## Shoulder Girdle Injuries
## Pelvic Injuries
 - Pain with pressure in iliac crests
 - unable to lift legs when supine
 - lateral rotation of foot can indicate
 - Unexplained pressure in bladder
 - bleeding from urethra or rectum
### Care
 - Move as little as possible
 - Straighten to anatomical position
 - Assume spinal injuries
## Hip Dislocation
 - Anterior foot rotation
## Hip Fracture
 - Localized Pain
 - Sensitive to pressure exerted on greater trochanter
 - discoloration
 - unable to stand or move legs

## Fermoral Shaft Fracture
 - Intense pain
 - Shortening of the limb
 - Possible Severe Fracture
## Care
 - Control Bleeding
 - Treat shock
 - assess distal CSM
 - apply traction splint
 - Reassess distal csm

## Knee Injury
 - Pain and tenederness
 - Swelling
 - Deformity with swelling
